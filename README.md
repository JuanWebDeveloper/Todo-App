# Example repository

# Challenge to develop

For this challenge we were asked to make improvements to the application from the previous repository, the is truth is that I was able to make a much better and more optimal application, so I created one from scratch following the requirements it should have.

As a final result, I created an application that has clean and understandable code and added the functionality to edit the name of the tasks, among a few other things.

It is also good to clarify that this application has a better interface and interactivity.
